# System Architecture - Academic Trip System

This document provides an overview of the Academic Trip System architecture, components, and their interactions.

## Architecture Overview

The Academic Trip System is built using a Java EE web application architecture with the following components:

### Key Components

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - JSP pages with TailwindCSS
   - Client-side JavaScript for enhanced interaction

2. **Controller Layer**
   - Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests
   - Request processing and response generation

3. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Service classes for implementing business rules
   - Data validation and processing

4. **Data Access Layer**
   - DAO (Data Access Object) classes for database operations
   - Database connection and transaction management

5. **Database**
   - Relational database for persistent data storage

## Component Interactions

### Request Flow

1. User submits a request through the browser
2. The request is routed to the appropriate servlet
3. The servlet processes the request with the help of service classes
4. Data is retrieved or modified through DAO classes
5. The servlet forwards the request to a JSP page or redirects to another URL
6. The JSP page renders the response using the data provided by the servlet

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits login credentials
2. The LoginServlet validates the credentials
3. Upon successful authentication, a user session is created
4. The user is redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on their role
5. Subsequent requests include session verification to ensure authorized access

## System Modules

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java EE (Servlets, JSP)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS), JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat
- **Build Tool**: Maven

## Security Measures

- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Input validation
- Prepared statements for database operations
- Password encryption

## Deployment Architecture

The system is designed to be deployed in a standard Java web application environment:

1. **Application Server**: Apache Tomcat 9.0+
2. **Database Server**: MySQL 8.0+
3. **Web Server** (optional): Apache HTTP Server or Nginx for SSL termination and load balancing

## Integration Points

- Email notification system
- Calendar system (optional)
- Institutional information system (optional)
